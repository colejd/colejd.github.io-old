            I'm a graduate student and assistant at the University of Maine at Orono 
            studying Spatial Information Science and Engineering. My current research interests 
            are in computer vision and augmented reality's potential for helping overcome 
            difficulties with sensory perception.

            I work at the <a href='http://www.vemilab.org/'> Virtual Environment and Multimodal 
            Interaction Laboratory</a>, where I write software for virtual reality, augmented reality, 
            and computer vision in research and interactive contexts. I work a lot with Unity and 
            OpenCV. Visit <a href='/about.html'>About Me</a> to learn more about what I know.

                    A hardware and software project to build an open-source and affordable 
                    augmented reality headset. In its current form, it resembles the Vive's 
                    Chaperone feature, though this was written before I knew about it. The 
                    software leverages OpenCV and is written for maximum performance on an 
                    average computer. The camera assembly costs ~$30 to build.

                    grants spanning two years to pursue this work, which sought to study the 
                    effects of Age-Related Macular Degeneration on driving ability. The work 
                    involved creating a VR driving simulator, as well as an automated test 
                    environment using this simulator that evaluates subject driving performance 
                    with and without simulated eye disease.
