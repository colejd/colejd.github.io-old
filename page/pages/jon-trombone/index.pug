                    This is what happens when I have too much free time. Jon-Trombone is a 3D scan of me hooked
                    up to a modified version of <a href="https://dood.al/pinktrombone/">Pink Trombone</a>, 
                    which simulates the nose and throat to produce synthesized human vocals. You can play
                    around with the controls in the upper-right.
                p.
                    Regrettably, this program supports MIDI playback. Use the GUI to load a MIDI file and
                    start the playback. Keep in mind that as of right now (wink wink nudge nudge) only one 
                    track is played, which you can control with the "Track" control in the GUI.
                p.
                    The source is available on <a href='https://github.com/colejd/jon-trombone'>GitHub</a>.

                    Thanks to Toni Kaplan for repairing and rigging the 3D model.
