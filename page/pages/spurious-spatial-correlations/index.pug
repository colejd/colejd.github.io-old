    h1 Spurious (Spatial) Correlations
    p
        | This is a project I did for Introduction to GIS at my university. Inspired by 
        a(href='http://www.tylervigen.com') Tyler Vigen's Spurious Correlations
        | , I wanted to apply similar techniques to GIS data in the state of Maine. Below are my results.

        h2 Eagles and K-Cups
        p
            | With the exception of Washington County, eagles seem to make their homes in areas where household K-Cup ownership is at or higher than the national average.

        p
            | 589 of Maineâ€™s 795 schools are within 3 km of an aquifer. This means that if you are at a school, there is a 74% chance that you are within walking distance of a significant source of groundwater.

            | US Cellular offers great coverage in areas where hazardous oil spills occur the most.

            | 3875 of Maine's 3929 cemeteries are located exactly within broadband coverage areas (98.63%).

        h2 Red Cross Facilities and Bedrock Formation Eras
        p
            | In what I can only consider to be a deliberate move, Red Cross has built their facilities in Maine on top of bedrock formed before the Devonian era. This means that if you got into a time machine and went back to the period at which the bedrock was formed beneath any Red Cross facility, you would not find sharks, ferns, trees, insects, or land vertebrates.
