This is the project structure I use to build my website. This constructs a static webpage and
supports publishing to GitHub Pages.

The actual website is built into the `/dist/` directory, which is then pushed to the master 
branch when you run `deploy`.


## Quick start:
```
npm install
gulp preview
```

Publish to GitHub with `gulp deploy`.
